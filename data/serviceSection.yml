      #### Statistical analysis

      Data is nothing but numbers if we do not know the context. When we do know the context, still we need skills to extract knowledge properly and without bias. It has many names: machine learning, econometrics, statistics, spatial analytics and biostatistics. I know their roots, and I can implement it.

      #### Data Management

      Cleaning, processing and storing data is an important task. Managing variety of data sources and types requires vast knowledge about the data itself, and methods of using the data. I have worked with relational databases, tables, documents, graphs, and spatial data at different scales.

      #### Data Wraggling

      Cleaning the data is not limited to just cleaning the data types, but also finding the anomalies and resolving them. I can process and clean the data in accordance to its origin, and verify its accuracy.
