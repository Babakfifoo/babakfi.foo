    # company overview
    overview: I used my Spatial data science skill into play to produce dashboards and functions for the startup. I provided data preparation infrastructure for one of the client so they can perform COÂ² emission estimation in U.S., Norway, Sweden and Finland. Dashboards contained maps and 3D visualisations.

    url: "https://www.wsp.com/fi-fi"
    location: Pasila, Helsinki
    overview: At WSP Consulting, I adapted to Finnish work culture while producing spatial analyses, visualizations, and 3D city models. I designed and conducted a pedestrian route choice forecast to estimate changes in pedestrian flow after project implementations. Additionally, I supported other units with spatial data preparation and cartography. At peak workload, I managed seven projects across various units. This role highlighted the need for a structured approach to project data that accommodates diverse datasets and documents, usable by non-data professionals, which inspired my path toward data engineering.
